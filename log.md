# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 24, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've created a react component to re-use on some projects

**Thoughts** As I'm starting the challenge and a new phase, I'm excited and wanted to have something small that I could finish today.

### Day 2: August 26, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I improved the new portfolio's Header component and started the projects list! So I implemented the Project component and I'm adding a tag system so I can specify which skills were used in every project I've developed.

**Thoughts** Still pretty excited!

### Day 3: August 27, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Besides putting together all the new components I've created so far in the new portfolio react app, I'm improving the Projects List component implementing a tags filter. Far from functional, but baby steps, right?!

**Thoughts** Struggled a little with CodeSandBox, so decided to create a local enviroment. I wasn't a smooth transition, but now that everything is working together, things will get easier.

### Day 4: August 28, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Still struggling with the filte.. I'm studying and trying a few react tutorials to find the best way to update the project's listing, depending on the filter selected.

**Thoughts** Finding it hard to understand exacly the flow, and was a little tired today. But it's part of the proccess.

### Day 5: August 31, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today I installed a router on my portfolio project, created the components, and updated the header with the router links. 

**Thoughts** Needed to have something "done" for my motivation's sake.. now going back to the projects filter, wish me luck!

### Day 6: September 1, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finally got to list all tags and years on the filter, but will need to improve these implementations someday. 

**Thoughts** Sometimes trying to do things "the beautiful way" can be exhausting and you'll end up doing it "the easy way" because it works. It's fine, tomorrow you can go back and improve it (but you probably won't)

### Day 10: September 5, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: After a few days avoiding the errors on my portfolio's filter, today I was ready to struggle the whole afternoon trying to figure it out.
Surprisingly, it took me 10min to solve it. The filter is filtering. 

**Thoughts**: Sometimes all you need is some time away.

### Day 11: September 8, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I started to implement the components of the Experience part of my portfolio. Also did some lessons from a React course I bought a while ago on Udemy.

**Thoughts**: Need to focus and define the scope of the project, it's hard to develop and decide things on the go.
