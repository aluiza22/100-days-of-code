# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 24, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've created a react component to re-use on some projects

**Thoughts** As I'm starting the challenge and a new phase, I'm excited and wanted to have something small that I could finish today.

### Day 2: August 26, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I improved the new portfolio's Header component and started the projects list! So I implemented the Project component and I'm adding a tag system so I can specify which skills were used in every project I've developed.

**Thoughts** Still pretty excited!
