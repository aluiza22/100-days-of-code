# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 24, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've created a react component to re-use on some projects

**Thoughts** As I'm starting the challenge and a new phase, I'm excited and wanted to have something small that I could finish today.

### Day 2: August 26, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I improved the new portfolio's Header component and started the projects list! So I implemented the Project component and I'm adding a tag system so I can specify which skills were used in every project I've developed.

**Thoughts** Still pretty excited!

### Day 3: August 27, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Besides putting together all the new components I've created so far in the new portfolio react app, I'm improving the Projects List component implementing a tags filter. Far from functional, but baby steps, right?!

**Thoughts** Struggled a little with CodeSandBox, so decided to create a local enviroment. I wasn't a smooth transition, but now that everything is working together, things will get easier.

### Day 4: August 28, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Still struggling with the filte.. I'm studying and trying a few react tutorials to find the best way to update the project's listing, depending on the filter selected.

**Thoughts** Finding it hard to understand exacly the flow, and was a little tired today. But it's part of the proccess.
